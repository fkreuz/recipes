Ingredients
1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar kosher salt and black pepper 2 medium zucchini (about 1 pound), halved and thinly sliced 1 15.5-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed 1 small shallot, thinly sliced 1/4 cup chopped salted roasted almonds 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill 1 cup bulgur 1 cup goat cheese, crumbled (4 ounces)
Directions
Whisk together the oil, vinegar, ¾ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.
Add the zucchini, beans, shallot, almonds, and dill and toss to combine. Let stand, tossing occasionally, until the zucchini softens slightly, 10 to 15 minutes.

Serve the bulgur topped with the zucchini salad and sprinkled with the goat cheese.
